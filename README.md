This repo contains progressive python challenges and exercises that can be used for self study.

Here is a list of the exercises:

* [01-exercises.ipynb](./exercises.ipynb) -- user input challenges
* [02-exercises.ipynb](./02-exercises.ipynb) -- functions and loops
* [03-exercises.ipynb](./03-exercises.ipynb) -- scope study and debug activity
* [04-exercises.ipynb](./04-exercises.ipynb) -- containers, control flow and functions 
* [05-exercises.ipynb](./05-exercises.ipynb) -- classes and inheritance
* [06-exercises.ipynb](./06-solutions.ipynb) -- more classes and inheritance

Each exercise has a corresponding solution file you may reference.

Some of these exerccises may require you to do some googling to figure out the solution. Some resources that are great to rely on are:

* [w3 schools python reference](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)
* [official python3 documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
* [real python tutorials](https://realpython.com/)
