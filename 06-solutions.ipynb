    "# Python ZOOP Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will be building a simulation of a virtual zoo using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Python. The goal of this lab is to practice defining base and derived classes, using constructors, and method overriding.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "* fork and clone this repo, cd into the new folder\n",
    "* use `zoo.py` to complete the assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Base `Animal` Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a base `Animal` class that has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* name\n",
    "* species\n",
    "* age\n",
    "* gender\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `describe` -- prints out all information about the animal\n",
    "* `feed` -- prints out `\"< animal name > is eating\"`\n",
    "* `make_sound` -- prints out `\"< animal name > is making a sound\"`\n",
    "* `move` -- prints out `\"< animal name > is moving\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extending the Base `Animal` Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Create the following child class that derives from the base `Animal` class, adding properties and\n",
    "using method override when needed:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Mammal` -- has a `fur_color` property that is printed out in it's description\n",
    "\t* drinks milk when feeding\n",
    "\t* walks when moving\n",
    "\t* growls when making a sound\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a `Zoo` class with an `animals` property that is a list of all of the animals in the zoo. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a `Zoo` Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Zoo` class should have the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `add_animal` -- adds an animal to the list \n",
    "* `display_animals` -- displays information for all animals\n",
    "* `feed_animals` -- feeds all animals\n",
    "* `listen_to_animals` -- listens to all the animals\n",
    "* `watch_animals` -- watches the animals move around\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus\n",
    "\n",
    "Create additional child classes to populate your zoo!\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Bird` -- has a `wingspan` property that is printed out in it's description\n",
    "\t* drinks nectar when feeding\n",
    "\t* flies when moving\n",
    "\t* chirps when making a sound\n",
    "* `Reptile` -- has a `scale_color` property that is printed out in it's description\n",
    "\t* eats insects when feeding\n",
    "\t* slithers when moving\n",
    "\t* hisses when making a sound\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Example code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "zoo = Zoo()\n",
    "\n",
    "lion = Mammal(\"Simba\", \"Lion\", 5, \"male\", \"golden\")\n",
